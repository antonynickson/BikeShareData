# Python-Intro
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. I will also make use of a packages like pandas and numpy to wrangle the dataset and visualize the data using matplotlib library
