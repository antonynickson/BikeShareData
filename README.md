# Data Wrangling and Data Visualization using Python - US Bike Share Data Project 
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore dataset related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States. I will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. I will also make use of a packages like pandas and numpy to wrangle the dataset and visualize the data using matplotlib library
